# Expense Tracker ðŸ§¾

A simple command-line Python app that helps users record and track their daily expenses.

## Features

- âœ… Add expenses with category and amount
- âœ… View all recorded expenses
- âœ… Calculate total expenditure

## How It Works

Expenses are stored in a local CSV file (`expenses.csv`) to simulate a lightweight database.

### Example

```bash
Track your Expenses!
Options:
1: Add an expense
2: View your expenses
3: View your total expenditure
4: Exit
